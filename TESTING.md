## Testing

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to [findapub](https://find-a-pub-project-35ccdd2a93a3.herokuapp.com)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected.

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

- Samsung A15
- iPad Pro
- Lenovo Ideapad S540

### Accessibility

Wave Accessibility tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed
- Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

### Fixed Bugs

| Bug | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| .phone_number was not appearing in database and throwing errors | After many attempts the fix was deleting the migrations, caches and database data and starting again |
| Persisting overflow issue on certain pages | After many attempts at locating and fixing the cause, the issue was found to be simply that certain rows were not contained within containers, thus breaking the bootstrap structure and causing overflow. |
| Favicon not showing on all pages apart from home page | Changed href to href="{% static 'images/apple-touch-icon.png' %}" etc. |
| Had trouble targeting active page in navbar | First issue: Changed to {% if request.resolver_match.url_name == 'home' %} instead of {% if request.path == home_url %}
Second issue: Changed name to the correct "Pubs" instead of "home" |
| Unable to target socials using CSS | Was using "a .socials {}" instead of ".socials a {}" |
